This project analysed a dataset containing Airbnb listings in the Northern Beaches council area of Sydney, with 28 featurs including the number of beds, baths, people, cleaning & deposite fees, reviews, GPS coordinates. I then used these features to train different machine learning models in Python to predict nightly rental price of Airbnb listings.


- Performed statistical imputation to handle significant amount of missing values
- Annalysed the distribution of continuous features, and the correlation between features and rental price.
- Performed log-normal transformation and z-score standardization of the features to handle non-linear relationships and highly-skewed distributions

â€¢	Exploratory Data Analysis
1. What are busiest locations and hours?
2. How are passengers per trip, payment type, fare and tip amounts distributed?
3. How do times and fares vary by trips?
4. Is it possible to characterise taxi drivers based on work hours and how much they make?
5. What features influence fare and tip amounts?
6. Can we build a model to predict fare and tip amount?
7. If you were a taxi owner, how would you maximize your earnings in a day?
8. If you run a taxi company with 10 taxis, how would you maximize your earnings?
9. What possible issues in the data might impact your approach?
10. What are the potential drawbacks to using the selected model? What other models might be useful?
